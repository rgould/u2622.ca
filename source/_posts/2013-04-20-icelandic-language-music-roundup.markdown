While focusing heavily on learning Icelandic, I dug deeply looking for Icelandic-language music. There are surprisingly high amounts of Icelandic bands that sing exclusively in English. Here are my favourite songs with Icelandic lyrics:

**Mammút** - They play energetic rock music, bordering on post-punk sometimes. The first Icelandic language band I liked, and my favourite still.
 Here's Svefnsýkt: <iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/aeGZriDklEo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
 Bónus: [Rauðilækur](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EV-pE4xaHI)

**Q4U** - Postpunk from the 80s, mostly in Icelandic. They're still around.
 Here's Sigurinn: <iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/iiWcZKhWlQA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
 Bónus: [Snjóhvít](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qM2yrG1wpY)

**Samaris** - Atmospheric minimal electro/triphop with clarinet. Very haunting.

**Nóra**: Indie rock, ranging from upbeat and energetic to atmospheric and introspective. The more I listen, the more I like it. They sing entirely in Icelandic.
 Here's Himinbrim: <iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/w66kIAWBFs8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
 Bónus: [Sjónskekkja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it2MTpGisJQ)

**Lockerbie** - Post-rock, but with a bit more pop/rock than usually characterised by Icelandic post-rock.
 Here's Snjóljón: <iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/cUWzNsPHcEQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

**Úlfur Úlfur** - Hiphop with awesome backing percussion. They sing entirely in Icelandic.
 Here's Út: <iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/jCgbt73gD74" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
 Bónus: [Ég er farinn](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0LWMJatU4s)

**Pascal Pinon** - D.I.Y., lo-fi, indie pop electronic. Many songs in Icelandic.
 Here's Ekki Vanmeta: <iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F71960187"></iframe>
 Bónus: [Sandur](https://soundcloud.com/iceland-music-export/pascal-pinon-sandur)

**Sólstafir** - Post-black metal, with elements of country and rock. They are amazing live. Their album Svartir Sandar is entirely in Icelandic and highly recommended.

There's lots of music that I've discovered that I didn't cover here, but I only wanted to showcase the music I liked the most. Feel free to leave other suggestions in the comments.
