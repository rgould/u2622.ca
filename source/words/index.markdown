A collection of my favourite words and phrases from various languages:

1. *sisu* - Finnish word for something akin to "stiff upper lip". It is used to
describe the Finnish spirit of extreme will and determination in the face of
adversity.

1. *Vergangenheitsbewältigung* - German word for dealing with issues from
the past. Literally 'past-overcoming'. Often means dealing with their
national socialist history.

1. *takk for sist* - Norwegian phrase, equivalently used in English somewhat
like "nice to see you again," but it literally means "thanks for last (time)."

1. *木漏れ日* (komorebi) - Japanese word, specifically referring to sunlight
filtering through leaves.
