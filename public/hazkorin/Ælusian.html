<p>
You are a descendent of the winds, light yet strong, slender and fast. You are at home in the Elemental Plane of Air, where your people build villages and towns on floating islands in an endless sky. Culture and crafting are important to you, but of uttermost importance is that of music.
</p>

<p>
Due to the shifting nature of the Plane of Air, with its constantly drifting islands, a map that is written down is out of date the second it is finished. And yet each floating mote on the plane can be traced, for they each have their own song. Know the song of a location, and you know how to find your way to it. Play the song, and you can guide yourself and others to it. As such, music is incredibly important to you, and to be silenced is a fate worse than death.
</p>

<p>
The wind and sky taint your appearance. Ælusians can pass as humans, though they tend to be slender like elves, but their elemental nature makes bluish features more prominent: eyes, hair, skin tone.
</p>

<p>
Ælusians have a natural talent for elemental magic, and can cast spells like wizards. They also spend considerable time training with martial weapons, and can handle themselves in battle. Their airy and elemental nature gives them more flexibility when wearing armour.
</p>

<p>
You are reknown for wading right into battle, wearing armour and and wielding fearsome magic. Your race is sought out by others to be hired as mercenaries, or as soldiers in foreign armies.
</p>

<p>
The Ælusians are lorded over by the Elemental Royalty. Their decrees guide their lives, and direct the building of their settlements, and launch crusades against the Lords of Elemental Earth. As such, each Ælusian begins their adventuring career Patron Bonded to one of the Elemental Royals.
</p>

<p>
<span id="Ælusian-Hit points:"></span><strong id="Hit points:">Hit points:</strong> An ælusian gains 1d8 hit points at each level.
</p>

<p>
<span id="Ælusian-Weapon training:"></span><strong id="Weapon training:">Weapon training:</strong> An ælusian is trained in the use of the spear, sword (any), dagger, club, mace, javelin, bow (any), staff, and sling. Ælusians can wear any armour, and they often do, even though it interferes with their spellcasting. They especially treasure mithril armour, and have been known to hunt down and ambush elves in their search for it.
</p>

<p>
<span id="Ælusian-Alignment:"></span><strong id="Alignment:">Alignment:</strong> The Elemental Royalty are all neutral, and thus most Ælusians are as well. It is rare for one to choose a side in the great cosmic battle; those that do are likely to be Ælusians who have settled outside of the Plane of Air.
</p>

<p>
<span id="Ælusian-Magic:"></span><strong id="Magic:">Magic:</strong> Ælusians practice arcane magic by channeling pure elemental energy, using spells from spellbooks similar to wizards. Due to their musical heritage, they have learned to use their voice to channel this energy, and cast their spells by singing, enabling them to cast their spells so long as they can use the vocal cords. They can also use musical instruments to channel this energy as well. Because of this, their spellbooks tend to resemble collections of recorded songs, rather than the arcane texts familiar to wizards. An Ælusian knows a number of spells as shown on the table below, modified by their Intelligence score.
</p>

<p>
They begin the game Patron Bonded to an Elemental Royal (see below), and tend to favour air-related spells, though they can learn any spell. To determine spells at first level, roll randomly as normal. The player may then choose to replace one of the random spells with any spell from the Elemental Air list (see below).
</p>

<p>
<span id="Ælusian-Elemental Affinity:"></span><strong id="Elemental Affinity:">Elemental Affinity:</strong> An Ælusian is considered to know of the existance of all of the spells on the Elemental Air list (see below); they do not need to quest for them, though they must still be studied to be learned. However, when studying a spell on the Elemental Air list, they roll a 1d24 when making the check (instead of a 1d20).
</p>

<p>
<span id="Ælusian-Caster level:"></span><strong id="Caster level:">Caster level:</strong> Same as elves and wizards (DCC RPG p57)
</p>

<p>
<span id="Ælusian-Supernatural Patron:"></span><strong id="Supernatural Patron:">Supernatural Patron:</strong> At 1st level, an Ælusian choose an Elemental Royal to whom they have been Patron Bonded. The receive the effects of the 24-23 level as though they had cast it on themselves. That is, the caster can cast invoke patron twice per day with a +1 bonus to the spell check, and they learn the Patron's first level spell, which can be cast once per day in place of invoke patron. The patron of course will call upon the caster to repay the favour at a later date. Note that this does not mean that the caster knows the spell Patron Bond. They may still learn it and bond themselves with other patrons as well. Surprisingly the Elemental Royals don't seem to be often bothered when Ælusians do this, except of course if they try to bond of with any of the Elemental Lords of Earth.
</p>

<p>
<span id="Ælusian-Spellburn:"></span><strong id="Spellburn:">Spellburn:</strong> Ælusians can spellburn in a manner similar to elves and wizards, but their usage is more restricted. They can only spellburn one point when casting a spell, but they add their elemental die to spell check result. This elemental die increases as the Ælusian levels up. Note that Ælusians can use Strength, Agility, Stamina, or Personality to power their elemental die.
</p>

<p>
<span id="Ælusian-Elemental burn:"></span><strong id="Elemental burn:">Elemental burn:</strong> Ælusians can channel elemental power to increase attack rolls, damage rolls, and spellcheck rolls. Using this ability must be done before the die is rolled, and the Ælusian must spend 1 point of Strength, Agility, Stamina, or Personality (temporarily) to do so. They then roll the elemental die, adding the result to the chosen roll. For example: Alizeh, a level 1 Ælusian, attacks a rock lobster with her spear. She decides to use elemental burn on the attack roll, reducing her Strength by 1, and then rolling 1d20 (attack roll) + 1d2 (elemental die) + attack modifiers (+1). She rolls 13 + 2 + 1 = 16, which is a hit. She can now use elemental burn again when rolling the damage dice, but she must spend another point of Strength, Agility, Stamina, or Personality to do so.
</p>

<p>
<span id="Ælusian-Speed:"></span><strong id="Speed:">Speed:</strong> Ælusians seem to flow with the air around them, as such their base movement speed is 35'.
</p>

<p>
<span id="Ælusian-Extraplanar:"></span><strong id="Extraplanar:">Extraplanar:</strong> Ælusians are children of the Elemental Plane of Air. This means they are affected by things that target extraplanar creatures, such as Banish, and some Ælusians have reported being summoned and bound to service by greedy wizards from the Prime Material Plane.
</p>

<p>
<span id="Ælusian-Armor Check Bonus:"></span><strong id="Armor Check Bonus:">Armor Check Bonus:</strong> Ælusians train in armour, and feel comfortable moving and casting spells in it. Their elemental nature also reduces the hindrance of wearing armour. They receive a bonus to offset the armour check penalty. This bonus increases as the Ælusian levels. This bonus can never bring the check penalty to higher than zero.
</p>

<p>
<span id="Ælusian-Source of Air:"></span><strong id="Source of Air:">Source of Air:</strong> Due to their connection to the Elemental Plane of Air, Ælusians always have a constant source of fresh air flowing into their lungs. This means they cannot drown. It is still easier and more efficient for them to breathe normally though, and so they are still suspectible to inhaling toxic substances if they are caught unawares. It may also be possible for this connection to the Plane of Air to be cut, under certain circumstances (such as entering a plane that has no connectivity to the Plane of Air).
</p>

<p>
<span id="Ælusian-Action Dice:"></span><strong id="Action Dice:">Action Dice:</strong> An Ælusian can use their action dice for attack rolls or spell checks.
</p>

<p>
<span id="Ælusian-Languages:"></span><strong id="Languages:">Languages:</strong> At 1st-level, an Ælusian automatically knows Common, and the Ælusian language. They gain one additional language for every point of Int modifier. Addtional languages are randomly determined as specified in Appendix L (use the Wizard table).
</p>

<p>
<span id="Ælusian-Luck:"></span><strong id="Luck:">Luck:</strong> If an Ælusian's luck modifier is positive, applies to all spellchecks made using Elemental Air spells. This changes if their luck changes.
